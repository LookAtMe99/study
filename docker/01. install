$ sudo yum-config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

# Optional: Enable the edge repository. This repository is included in the docker.repo file above but is disabled by default. You can enable it alongside the stable repository.
$ sudo yum-config-manager --enable docker-ce-edge
